  <h1>Welcome to ISSEP 2025</h1>
      
  <p>
    The International Conference on Informatics in Schools: Situation, Evolution and Perspectives (ISSEP)
    is a forum for researchers and practitioners in the area of Informatics education,
    in both primary and secondary schools. The conference provides an opportunity for educators and researchers
    to reflect upon the goals and objectives of this subject matter, its curricula, various teaching and
    learning paradigms and topics, as well as the connections to everyday life — including the various ways
    of developing Informatics Education in schools.
